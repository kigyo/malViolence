    "(Not that you {i}liked {/i}that brat who trapped you in a room with lethal puzzles and called you a lab rat.)"

    "(But the silence forces you to focus on something much louder and much more disturbing. Thoughts that've collapsed in your mind like juices from a rotting apple.)"

    "(You think about Dr. Dan – no. {i}Dr. Deidre Destrange{/i}.)"

    "(You think about the results of your investigation.)"

    "(Maybe it was those blueprints. Or that corkboard.)"

    "(Yeah... they were pretty scary, weren't they?)"

    "(No wonder you've got goosebumps. Even if Dr. Danger's dead and gone, Cautionne's more than capable of taking her place. You've seen it for yourself.)"
