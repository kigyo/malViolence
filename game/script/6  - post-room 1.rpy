  c "Well, well, well. If it isn't the {i}lab rat{/i}."

  c "For someone with chronic-resting- \"Blah\"-face, you look real proud of yourself."

  c "And you know what? You should be. "

  c "By getting {i}this {/i}far, you've shown more brains than 96\% of S.T.O.P. employees. So congrats!"

  #"{b}[pause]{/b}"

  c "...That said, I actually expected you to die by now. I'm not sure how to reward you."

  c "Ooh – wait, wait. I have an idea!"

  c "How about a sticker? If you get out of here, I'll give you a fruit-scented one!"

  "{b}({/b}{b}if{/b}{b} player has investigated all items){/b}"

  c "At the rate you're going, you might even get one of my suuuuuuuper special grape stickers."

  c "And I {i}never{/i}{i} {/i}give those out."

  #"{b}[pause]{/b}"

  c "Huh. I don't see you jumping for joy."

  c "Not a grape fan?"

  "{b}({/b}{b}if{/b}{b} player has investigated some items){/b}"

  c "Though if you were expecting a grape-scented sticker, you're outta luck. I slap the best ones all over my tech!"

  c "Huh. You're not smiling or anything."

  c "Not a sticker superfan?"

  "{b}({/b}{b}if{/b}{b} player has investigated no items){/b}"

  c "But at the rate you're going… Oof."

  c "You might not even deserve the {i}durian-scented{/i} one. "

  c "Hey, maybe you're just terminally un-curious, and a lifelong sticker-hater. "

  c "No shame in being a hater. I hate things 24/7!"

  #"{b}[pause]{/b}"

  c "{size=-3}...Not even gonna argue against that, huh?"

  #"{b}[normal dialogue branch]{/b}"

  c "Oh well. More for me! "

  "{b}({/b}{b}and{/b}{b} if no items investigated) {/b}"

  c "{size=-3}Even the durian ones.{/size}"

  c "So, what did you think of our- "

  c "{i}-my{/i} Research Lab?"

  c "It's awesome, isn't it? "

  c "A little \"derivative\", maybe, but any scientist worth their salt needs a room filled with hi-tech computers and big fat source libraries."

  c "Though, there is {i}one {/i}thing that makes my lab better than the others. My {i}Primary Source Extractor!{/i}"

  c "It's kinda loud once it revs up, and it's a pain to clean afterwards. But the results are... {i}mwah!{/i}"

  c "I {i}had {/i}planned on giving you a first-hand demonstration, but the last experiment's results got so messy that I'm still cleaning the rafters."

  c "Disappointing, I know. "

  c "But never fear! The Great Cautionne, Emperor of MalViolence, used his aptitude for adaptation to his advantage."

  c "And so, he constructed these quasi-deadly puzzle rooms, sure to satisfy even the least imaginative of STOP agents."

  c "Aren't I thoughtful, lab rat?"

  #"{b}[pause]{/b}"

  c "{size=-3}{i}…Yeesh,{/i} tough crowd. You must be fun at parties.{/size}"

  c "Anyway, enough dilly-dallying! "

  c "{i}Vamoose{/i} to the next room already. There's more games for you to play!"

  c "Or hell, take your sweet time. I've always wanted to see how motivating electrified floors can be."

  "(He's clearly joking again.)"

  "(Probably. Maybe.)"

  "(...No. Better not tempt fate.)"
